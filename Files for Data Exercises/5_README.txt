The file "SchoolEarnings.csv" contains data on earnings and schooling.

The data is from a 1991 study by Angrist and Krueger entitled "Does
Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings?"published 
in the Quarterly Journal of Economics.

Angrist and Krueger obtained their data from the Integrated Public Use
Microdata Series from the 1980 U.S. Census.

The study specifically focused on men born between 1930 and 1939, so they
were 41-50 years old at the time of data collection.

Each row corresponds to a large group of men with the same level of
schooling.

The variable "schooling" indicates the years of schooling for each group.
12 corresponds with high school completion, and 16 corresponds with 
college completion.

The variable "earnings" indicates the average annual earnings (in 1980
U.S. dollars) for the men in each group.
